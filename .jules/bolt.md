## 2024-05-23 - Reuse HashMap Scopes
**Learning:** In interpreter loops (`Stmt::For`), allocating a new `HashMap` for scope in every iteration causes significant allocator churn. Reusing a single `HashMap` and clearing it provides ~10% performance improvement in loop-heavy code.
**Action:** When implementing block scopes in loops, prefer clearing and reusing the scope container over re-allocating it.
