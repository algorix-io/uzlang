## 2025-05-23 - DNS Rebinding & SSRF Bypass
**Vulnerability:** The `is_safe_url` function performed string-based validation of hostnames (e.g., blocking "localhost" or "127.*"), which can be bypassed by using a public domain that resolves to a private IP (e.g., `localtest.me` -> `127.0.0.1`).
**Learning:** String matching on URLs is insufficient for security controls. Attackers can control DNS resolution to point innocuous-looking domains to internal resources.
**Prevention:** Always resolve the hostname to an IP address and validate the IP against a blocklist of private/reserved ranges before making the request. Use `std::net::ToSocketAddrs` (in Rust) or similar mechanisms. Be aware of TOCTOU (Time-of-Check Time-of-Use) issues with DNS rebinding if the HTTP client re-resolves the domain; for critical systems, use a custom resolver or pin the IP.
